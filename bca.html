            <h4>Does advocacy need to be done in person? While many other facets of our lives have moved online, most modes of community action have remained stagnant - depending primarily on in-person meetings, group protests, and door-to-door canvassing. The core aim of this application is to show that good, informed, and non-partisan activism can be done online and to create an architecture that can support and facilitate it.

                 <h2>PROJECT CONTEXT:</h2>
            <h4>This mobile application was created over the course of a semester as the primary deliverable for a user interface design course.</h4>

            <h2>MY ROLE:</h2>
            <h4>I contributed to the research and design process with two other classmates, Amrit Daswaney and Vasiliki "Vicky" Laina.</h4>
                    
            <h2>PROBLEM:</h2>
            <h4>Each member was responsible for creating an integrative platform for one user group. Vicky oversaw a platform for academic influencers providing educational material for general users; Amrit constructed a platform for elected representatives to showcase their progress on community endeavors; and I created a platform for citizen users (established community activists and laypersons alike) to educate themselves on topics and discover ways to get involved online and offline. </h4>
                    
            <h2>PROCESS:</h2>
            <h4>We used the Double-Diamond design model to approach this project. We had frequent team meetings to discuss our design process, user testing, and subsequent iterations, and to ensure our individual platforms were complementary and cohesive to the project as a whole.</h4>
                    
            <h2>SOLUTION:</h2>
            <h4>We are still working to complete this project - the final deliverables will be posted in a few weeks.</h4>

Four individuals (three millenials; 1 middle-aged) were asked questions about their backgrounds in community activism before beginning the guided usability testing. Audio and video recording were conducted with simultaneous note-taking during the test administration. The test was concluded with debriefing questions.</h4></div>

        <div class="projectBox">
        <h4>1. Notifications on the “home navigation” page provided shortcuts to only some core features. If there were no new notifications for messages or social circle connections, these features could only be accessed through the “Get Involved” page for an arbitrary topic, which was not intuitive or speedy for a global task like viewing messages. It was difficult to switch between these tasks without a menu allowing global access to these features.<br><br>
            
            2. The significance of the bubbles used to represent exploration topics on the “home navigation” page was not meaningful. Users did not realize that bubble size correlated with budget/popularity, and in fact, large bubble size seemed to bias attention, discouraging actual “exploration”. Similarly, defaulting to sorting by budget was not meaningful for citizen users, who do not usually think of community issues in terms of their budgets.<br><br>
            
            3. The “topic navigation” page was easy to scan and understand.<br><br>
            
            4. The “Get Involved” and “Discuss” pages were too cluttered. It took longer to locate goal-oriented features on these pages, and the buttons and text were small and impractical for a mobile platform.<br><br>
            
            5. Users expressed the desire to have social features integrate with existing popular platforms. For example, events might populate in a calendar app or could be shared to Facebook or Twitter.

        <h4>Feedback from the user interviews suggested redesigning the unsuccessful “home navigation” page to have improved accessibility to core features and include a more intuitive, less biased presentation of exploration topics. Based on feedback from user testing, the Gestalt principle of size may have unintentionally imposed a hierarchy on the topics to explore such that it was difficult for users to perceive topics with small bubbles when also viewed beside topics with large bubbles, so unifying the size of each topic might help eliminate this accidental bias (Graham, 2008).<br><br>
            
        The “topic navigation” page was viewed favorably and encompasses the usability heuristic of aesthetic and minimalist design, as compared to the overcrowded “Get Involved” and “Discuss” user flows. As such, it may provide guidance on simplifying features and breaking apart the dual functions each of these pages offer (“Get Involved” includes Events and Social Circles, and “Discuss” includes Forums and Polls, which might be better split apart by an additional navigation menu; see newest prototype iteration) (Nielsen, 1995). This would also better fulfill the usability heuristic of physical interaction and ergonomics, as fewer sections of information on the same page would increase the size of buttons and scrollbars to better suit the natural posture and size of the user’s hand in using this mobile platform (Inostroza, et al., 2013). </h4></div>

            <h4>The primary objectives of the first phase of usability testing for the citizen user interface were to (i) test the efficacy of the visual presentation of the two main navigation pages (“home navigation” and “topic navigation”) and to (ii) assess the ease of task-switching between actions permitted on the “topic navigation” page. Four individuals (three millenials; 1 middle-aged) were asked questions about their backgrounds in community activism before beginning the guided usability testing. Audio and video recording were conducted with simultaneous note-taking during the test administration. The test was concluded with debriefing questions.</h4></div>

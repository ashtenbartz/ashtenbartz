            <h4><i>Adolescence is a time of immense, puberty-driven change:</i> a burgeoning sense of self; increased autonomy; experimentation with new social and romantic relationships; the exploration of academic and extracurricular interests....<br><br>

            As if balancing good grades and going on your first date weren’t already challenging enough, having several conflicting priorities makes it even more difficult for teens to reserve time for an essential, but devalued activity: getting sufficient sleep.<br><br>

            Research demonstrates that insufficient sleep during adolescence increases one’s risk for obesity by 60 to 90%, and sleep and eating habits established during these formative years can remain with an individual for decades to come. This evidence, and the unparalleled importance of sleep in nearly every domain of waking life, made it especially meaningful for me to contribute to a sleep research study investigating food choices in healthy normal-weight and overweight adolescents.</h4>

                 <h2>TIMEFRAME:</h2>
            <h4> This project took place during year 1 of a 5-year NIH-funded grant. Participants lived at the sleep lab for almost 2 weeks on a shifted sleep schedule, where the length of the "day" they experienced was longer than our typical 24-hour day, resulting in shifted bedtimes, rise times, and meal times. </h4>

            <h2>MY ROLE:</h2>
            <h4>After finishing undergrad, I worked at the lab for 5 years, assisting with this research study in various ways from its onset to its conclusion. At the time of this particular piece of the project, my role as a data management research assistant was to review all meal data at the end of the year 1 collection period and work towards finalizing a cleaned &amp; coded data set.</h4>
                    
            <h2>PROBLEM:</h2>
            <h4>During this review, I found that the data were compromised by errors due to challenges experienced by users of the paper menu. I approached the lab director with these findings and a proposition to reconsider the existing mealtime procedures before year 2 of the research study began.</h4>
                    
            <h2>PROCESS:</h2>
            <h4>The lab director agreed we needed to overhaul the system, and so I conducted user research to inform the transformation of the paper menu into a computerized platform.</h4>
                    
            <h2>SOLUTION:</h2>
            <h4>The new digitized ordering system was successfully implemented and used for the remaining 4 years of the grant, markedly reducing human errors associated with the former paper menu system.</h4>

            <h4>The participant menu was converted from a 4-page paper document to a 1-page computer interface using color and boldface to distinguish between food categories and similar item flavors. The red pop-up window at the bottom of the page prevented a participant from submitting their menu until items from all mandatory categories had been selected. The submit button created a new pop-up window allowing a participant to review their summarized selections before further editing their menu or approving its submission.</h4></div>

            <h4>The supervising tech interface replaced the previous need for supervising techs to transcribe the menus by automatically generating a tech menu after the participant had submitted their order. This intuitive interface allowed a supervising tech to quickly and easily print the menus and then return to their primary task, running the protocol. </h4></div>

            <h4>The new tech menu remained a paper document, because this was the easiest way to utilize it in the kitchen during meal preparation, but it was converted from a 4-page document to a 1-page document listing only the items the participant had ordered. Additionally, the novel inclusion of meal preparation instructions for each food item eliminated the need for techs to recall these procedures from memory, consequently lowering their cognitive load during this task.</h4></div>

            <h4>I worked with the programmer to set up the menu interface on the lab computers, which successfully replaced the previous paper system for the remaining 4 years of the study. The use of an automated, computerized system helped to markedly reduce errors, and as such, improve the quality of the data. The ability to export saved orders into a .csv file also saved time and effort for the data management team in more quickly and effectively scaffolding data entry.

            <h4>Sleep is critical to early physical and mental health development in children, and the ramifications of insufficient sleep can manifest themselves during the day through issues with attention, appropriate behavior, normal socialization, emotional regulation, performance at school, and many other domains. Sleep problems in children cited in the literature include a variety of insomnias, such as behavioral insomnia, explained as a child’s refusal to cooperate with a parent’s attempts at putting the child to bed; anxiety-related insomnia, in which sleep-onset is delayed due to worrying; and physiological insomnia, in which physiological causes may underlie delayed sleep onset (Hannan &amp; Hiscock, 2015).<br><br>
                
            We aim to design a bedtime buddy for children to help address some of the sleep complaints cited above by means of helping them fall asleep more quickly, entrain their circadian rhythms, and exhibit healthy sleep hygiene habits. We will do this by combining an augmented everyday object (the bedtime companion) with ambient media (sensors and digital screens in the bedroom).

                 <h2>PROJECT CONTEXT:</h2>
            <h4>This design was explored as a final project idea for a master's course in tangible user interfaces. We elected to design a pair of interactive toys (one for the child and one for the parent) that would help improve a child's bedtime routine.</h4>

            <h2>MY ROLE:</h2>
            <h4>I contributed to the research and design process with two other classmates, Weijia Zhou and Yunjie Yao.</h4>
                    
            <h2>PROBLEM:</h2>
            <h4>The final project required us to develop a tangible interface through which an interesting interaction could be explored. Our group decided to explore solutions for helping children fall asleep more easily.</h4>
                    
            <h2>PROCESS:</h2>
            <h4>As a group, we conducted literature reviews, hypothesized interaction scenarios, and created sketches and storyboards.</h4>
                    
            <h2>SOLUTION:</h2>
            <h4>After a few rounds of iteration, we realized we were struggling most with creating an interesting and engaging interaction in the problem space we had selected, because preparing a child for bed meant disengaging from stimulating interactions. As such, we decided as a group to pivot and address a different problem space for our final project.</h4>
